Computationally intensive jobs can be submitted to a compute node that is managed by Slurm. This compute node is the <strong>kooplex-cn16</strong>. It has 48 CPUs and 232 GB memory.
Submitting jobs to this compute node should be done like:
<br>
sbatch -n $NCPU --partition=normal thescript.sh
<br>
where NCPU is the number of cpus.
<br>
There is a prepared jobscript under .... <br>
Please refer to this <a href="https://slurm.schedmd.com/quickstart.html" target="_blank">manual</a> for further instructions on how to submit jobs.
<br>
When submitting a job the access paths are the same for /home/<username> and the large data storages. All other folders won't be accessible for the submnitted scripts.
