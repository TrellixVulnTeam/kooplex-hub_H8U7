Signing in with different login method will create independent accounts and the created account names depending on the chosen method. In the future it will be possible to connect the various accounts.
<br>
On the educational platform some of the methods are disabled, signing in is possible only with <em>ELTE neptun</em> and <em>caesar</em> accounts.
<br>
A visitor without any external account (e.g. EduID) can register an account, which needs an administrators approval.
<br>
Some features are available without signing in such as course materials and reports.
